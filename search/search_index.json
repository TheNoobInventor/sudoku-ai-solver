Next, OpenCV is applied to locate and extract the sudoku board from the image. After this, each cell of the board is located then checked for digits in them. If there is a digit present, a Deep Learning model trained for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is employed to identify it. At this point, given the cell locations and digits, a python script is run to solve the sudoku puzzle. Finally, the solved puzzle is displayed as an image to the user.</p> <p>Most of these steps can be accomplished using OpenCV, however, training the OCR model involves using the Keras and Tensorflow libraries. The packages, libraries and frameworks used in this project are listed below:</p> <ul> <li>OpenCV - Open source library that provides real-time computer vision tools, functions and hardware.</li> <li>JupyterLab - Web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code and data.</li> <li>Tensorflow - An Artificial Intelligence library that is used to build, train and deploy Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.</li> <li>Keras - A Deep Learning library that provides an interface for Tensorflow.</li> <li>Numpy - A Python library used for multidimensional array manipulation and calculations, basic linear algebra, statistical operations and more.

The python package manager, pip, is used to install the python packages in the list above -- pip can be installed from here. Afterwards, the python packages are installed by executing this command in a terminal:</p> <pre><code>pip install numpy matplotlib imutils jupyter jupyterlab scikit-image tensorflow pytest\n</code></pre> <p>Keras is automatically installed with Tensorflow.

The image needs to be processed before the puzzle can be extracted from it. The image is processed in the following steps and these are found in the <code>find_puzzle(img)</code> function in the notebook:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Convert the resized image to grayscale</p> <p>This is achieved using the following OpenCV function:</p> <p><code>gray = cv2.cvtColor(img,cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)</code></p> <p>This is a requirement for the other processing steps to work.</p> </li> <li> <p>Filter noise from the image</p> <p>The Gaussian Blur is used to filter noise from the image. The general form of the <code>cv2.GaussianBlur()</code> function syntax is as follows:</p> <p><p>GaussianBlur(src, dst, ksize, sigmaX, sigmaY)</p></p> <p>Where,</p> <ul> <li>src - Input image.</li> <li>dst - Output image of same size and type as src.</li> <li>ksize - Gaussian kernel size[height width ]. The kernel is a group of pixels that move along the src image pixel being worked on by the filter. Height and width must be odd numbers and can have different values. If ksize is set to [0,0], then ksize is computed from sigma value.</li> <li>sigmaX - Kernel standard derivation along X-axis (horizontal direction).</li> <li>sigmaY - Kernel standard derivation along Y-axis (vertical direction). If sigmaY = 0 then sigmaX value is taken for sigmaY.</li> </ul> <p>In the notebook, GaussianBlur is applied on the gray image with the following kernel size and sigmaX value:</p> <p><code>blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (7,7), 3)</code></p> <p>More information on GaussianBlur and other OpenCV filtering and blurring techniques can be read about here and here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Image thresholding</p> <p>The next image processing step is thresholding. In attempting to find the puzzle from an image, being able to detect the edges and shapes within the image are important. Thresholding is a method of segmenting an image into different regions or contours. </p> <p>A binary threshold is applied on the blurred grayscale image to convert it to consist of only two values, 0 or 255 - black or white respectively. The <code>cv2.adaptiveThreshold()</code> function was used to achieve this and it has the following general syntax:  </p> <p><p>adaptiveThreshold(src, dst, maxValue, adaptiveMethod, thresholdType, blockSize, C)</p></p> <p>Where,</p> <ul> <li>src - Input image.</li> <li>dst - Output image of same size and type as src.</li> <li>maxValue - Non-zero value assigned to the pixels for which the condition is satisifed.</li> <li>adaptiveMethod - Adaptive thresholding algorithm to use. There are two adaptiveThreshold algorithms: ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C and ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C.</li> <li>thresholdType - Thresholding type that must be either THRESHOLD_BINARY or THRESHOLD_BINARY_INV.</li> <li>blockSize - Size of a pixel neighborhood that is used to calculate a threshold value for the pixel: 3, 5, 7 and so on.</li> <li>C - Constant subtracted from the mean or weighted mean. It is normally positive but may be zero or negative as well. </li> </ul> <p>The following command in the notebook applies an adaptiveThreshold to the blurred grascale image:</p> <p><code>thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(blurred, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C,                                  cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV, 11, 2)</code></p> <p>Here the maxValue is set to 255, any pixel value in the image above 255 is set to 0, otherwise it is set to 255. This happens because the thresholdType is set to THRESHOLD_BINARY_INV, where INV stands for inverse. The thresholded image is shown below.</p> <p><p> </p></p> </li> </ul> <p>The next steps are to find the contours in the thresholded image and sort them in descending order to locate the outline of the sudoku puzzle. </p> <p>As the name suggests, the <code>cv2.findContours()</code> function is used to retrieve the contours from the thresholded image and its use is shown in the code block below:</p> <pre><code># Find contours in the thresholded image and sort them by size in descending order\ncnts = cv2.findContours(thresh.copy(), cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)\ncnts = imutils.grab_contours(cnts)\ncnts = sorted(cnts, key=cv2.contourArea, reverse=True)\n</code></pre> <p>A copy of the thresholded image is passed into the function with the parameters: CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE, a contour approximation method which encodes a rectangular contuor with 4 points, and RETR_EXTERNAL, a contour retrieval method which retrieves only the extreme outer contours. Other options for contour approximation and retrieval modes are found here and here respectively. </p> <p>The <code>imutils</code> package function, <code>grab_contours()</code>, returns the contours obtained in the previous line of code and these contours are then sorted by area in reverse/descending order. Two OpenCV functions, <code>cv2.arcLength()</code> and <code>cv2.approxPolyDP()</code>, are used to determine the puzzle outline. The applications of these functions are shown in the code blocks below:</p> <pre><code># Initialize a contour that corresponds to the puzzle outline\npuzzle_cnt = None\n\n# Loop over the contours\nfor c in cnts:\n    # Approximate the coutour\n    peri = cv2.arcLength(c, True) \n    approx = cv2.approxPolyDP(c, 0.02 * peri, True)\n\n    # If the approximated contour has 4 points, then it is assumed that \n    # this contour is the puzzle outline\n    if len(approx) == 4:\n        puzzle_cnt = approx\n        break\n</code></pre> <p>Firstly, the puzzle outline variable, <code>puzzle_cnt</code>, is initialized. , the contours are looped over to find the perimeter of the contour with <code>cv2.arcLength()</code> while <code>cv2.approxPolyDP()</code> returns an approximated contour of the passed in contour. The figure 0.02 specifies the maximum variance between the original contour and the perimeter of the approximation, that is, the appromixation is 2% of the original contour. If the approximated contour has 4 points, it is assumed that this is the puzzle contour.</p> <p>The obtained puzzle outline is drawn on the copy of the original image, using the <code>cv2.drawContours()</code> function, in the following lines of code:</p> <pre><code>puzzle_outline = img.copy()\ncv2.drawContours(puzzle_outline, [puzzle_cnt], -1, (0, 255, 0), 3)\n</code></pre> <p>The contour index is -1 and a negative value indicates that all contours are drawn, (0, 255, 0) is the line color (green in this case) and 3 is the line thickness. More information on <code>cv2.drawContours()</code> is available here.</p> <p>The puzzle outline is shown in the image below.</p> <p> </p> <p>Before moving on to locating and extracting digits in the puzzle, it is necessary to deskew the puzzle image, to a top-down bird's eye view to make it easier to determine rows, columns and cells of the sudoku puzzle. This operation is achieved by using the <code>four_point_transform()</code> function from the <code>imutils</code> package on both color and grayscale puzzle images:</p> <pre><code>color_puzzle = four_point_transform(img, puzzle_cnt.reshape(4,2)) \ngray_puzzle = four_point_transform(gray, puzzle_cnt.reshape(4,2))  \n</code></pre> <p>The method <code>reshape(4,2)</code> reshapes the array of the puzzle contour to have a shape of (4, 2), the required format for the <code>four_point_transform()</code> function. The image below shows the grayscale version after applying the transform. </p> <p> </p> <p>The <code>find_puzzle()</code> function returns the transformed images <code>color_puzzle</code> and <code>gray_puzzle</code> that will be used in subsequent steps in the sudoku AI solver as shown in this line of the main program cell in the notebook: </p> <pre><code># Find puzzle in the image. Set debug to False to disable displaying image \n# processing steps.\ncolor_puzzle, gray_puzzle = find_puzzle(img, debug=True)\n</code></pre> <p>The next step in the solver is to localize each cell in the puzzle.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#localize-each-cell","title":"Localize each cell","text":"<p>In order to localize each cell, the sudoku board needs to be initialized, split into individual cells and then generate the (x-y) coordinate location of each cell.

The steps of the <code>generate_cell_locations()</code> function are shown in the following code block:</p> <pre><code># Initialize a list to store (x,y) coordinates of each cell location\ncell_locs = []\n\n# Loop over the grid lcoations\nfor y in range(9):\n    # Initialize the current list of cell locations\n    row = []\n\n    for x in range(9):\n        # Compute the starting and ending (x,y) coordinates of the current cell\n        start_x = x * step_x\n        start_y = y * step_y\n        end_x = (x + 1) * step_x\n        end_y = (y + 1) * step_y\n\n        # Add the (x,y) coordinates to the cell locations list\n        row.append((start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y))\n\n        # Crop the cell from the gray_puzzle transformed image and then extract\n        # the digit from the cell\n        cell = gray_puzzle[start_y:end_y, start_x:end_x]\n        digit = extract_digit(cell)\n\n        # Confirm that the digit is not empty\n        if digit is not None:\n            classify_digit(digit, x, y)\n\n    # Add the row to the cell locations\n    cell_locs.append(row)\n\nreturn cell_locs\n</code></pre> <p>The function starts by initializing a list, <code>cell_locs</code>, to store the (x, y) coordinates of each cell location. It then iterates over each grid location of the sudoku board, row by row, and appends the <code>start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y</code> values of each cell in a list. </p> <p>The figure below illustrates a typical cell with the start and end (x, y) coordinates.</p> <p> </p> <p>For each iteration, the <code>generate_cell_locations()</code> function calls the <code>extract_digit()</code> function to determine if there is a digit present in the current cell. This process of digit extraction is shown in the code block below:</p> <pre><code># Apply automatic thresholding to the cell and then clear any connected borders \n# that touch the border of the cell\nthresh = cv2.threshold(cell, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV | cv2.THRESH_OTSU)[1]\nthresh = clear_border(thresh)\n\n# Find contours in the thresholded cell\ncnts = cv2.findContours(thresh.copy(), cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)\ncnts = imutils.grab_contours(cnts)\n\n# If no contours were found then this is an empty cell\nif len(cnts)==0:\n    return None\n\n# Otherwise find the largest contour in the cell and create a mask for \n# the contour\nc = max(cnts, key=cv2.contourArea)\nmask = np.zeros(thresh.shape, dtype=\"uint8\")\ncv2.drawContours(mask, [c], -1, 255, -1)\n\n# Compute the perecentage of masked pixels relative to the total area of the image\n(h, w) = thresh.shape\npercent_filled = cv2.countNonZero(mask) / float(w * h)\n\n# If less than 3% of the mask is filled then we are looking at noise and \n# can safely ignore the contour\nif percent_filled &lt; 0.03:\n    return None\n\n# Apply the mask to the thresholded cell\ndigit = cv2.bitwise_and(thresh, thresh, mask=mask) \n\nreturn digit\n</code></pre> <p>Similar to finding the outline of the sudoku puzzle, thresholding techniques are also applied here in extracting the digit. The function <code>clear_border()</code>, from the <code>skimage.segmentation</code> library, is used to clear any connected borders touching a respective cell border. The next step is to find contours in the thresholded cell, if no contours are found, <code>None</code> is returned. If there are contours present in <code>cnts</code>, the largest contour by pixel area is found and a mask is created for it. </p> <p>Dividing the pixel area of the mask by the area of the cell itself gives the <code>percentFilled</code> value, that is, how much the cell is \"filled up\" with white pixels. This percentage is used to confirm if the contour is noisy or if contains a digit; any percentage less than 3% is assumed to contain only noise. </p> <p>If the cell is not noisy, the mask is applied to the thresholded image and the digit is returned. As an example, the extracted cell of the bottom left hand corner from the puzzle <code>sudoku.jpg</code> is shown below.</p> <p> </p> <p>The returned digit is then classified using the <code>classify_digit()</code> function with the steps shown in the following code block:</p> <pre><code># Resize the digit to 28x28 pixels and prepare it classification. \n# 28x28 is the size of images in the MNIST dataset\nroi = cv2.resize(digit, (28, 28))\nroi = roi.astype(\"float\")/255.0\nroi = img_to_array(roi)\nroi = np.expand_dims(roi, axis=0)\n\n# Classify the digit and update the sudoku board with the prediction\npred = model.predict(roi, verbose=0).argmax(axis=1)[0]\nunsolved_board[y, x] = pred\n</code></pre> <p>The digit, <code>roi</code>, is resized to 28x28 pixels -- the size of the images in the MNIST dataset used to train deep learning models for optical character recognition. The <code>roi</code> digit is preprocessed before the <code>predict()</code> method is called on the <code>model</code> to predict the digit. The sudoku board is then updated with this prediction, thus replacing the default value of 0.</p> <p>The current row of the board is appended to <code>cell_locs</code> list and this process continues until all the rows of the sudoku board have been worked on. </p> <p>The following subsection briefly explains the process involved in building the deep learning model used by the <code>classify_digit()</code> function for OCR.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#deep-learning-model-for-optical-character-recognition-ocr","title":"Deep Learning model for Optical Character Recognition (OCR)","text":"<p>Deep learning is a subset of Machine Learning (itself a subset of Artificial Intelligence) techniques that use artificial neural network architectures to learn from data. Neural networks are layers of nodes, similar to the neurons in the human brain, that attempt to simulate the brain's ability to learn from large amounts of data and make predictions. The nodes within individual layers are connected to adjacent ones. The network is said to be 'deep' depending on the number of hidden layers it has. Traditional neural networks only contain 2-3 hidden layers, while deep networks can have as many as 150. </p> <p>The figure below shows the layout of a typical neural network. </p> <p> </p> <p>Deep learning models are trained using a large set of labeled data and neural network architectures that learn features directly from the data without the need for manual feature extraction. Convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) is one of the most popular types of deep neural networks. A CNN convolves learned features with input data, and uses 2D convolutional layers, making this architecture well suited to processing 2D data, such as images.</p> <p>The CNN works by extracting features directly from images. The relevant features are not pretrained; they are learned while the network trains on a collection of images. This automated feature extraction makes deep learning models highly accurate for computer vision tasks such as object classification. The figure below illustrates the CNN process for classifying handwritten digits. </p> <p> </p> <p>More information about convolutional neural networks can be found here and here. </p> <p>To perform optical character recognition on the digits obtained from the <code>extract_digit()</code>, a convolutional neural model is built and trained using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a classic dataset that contains 28x28 pixels sized images of handwritten digits, with 60,000 images for model training and 10,000 images for model testing. The handwritten images are grayscale single digits from 0 to 9. A sample of these images is shown below.</p> <p> </p> <p>The MNIST dataset is part of the Keras deep learning library so it only needs to be loaded to the <code>train_digit_classifier.ipynb</code> notebook, in the <code>model_files</code> directory, used to build and train the OCR deep learning model.</p> <p>To build the deep learning model, the following packages need to be imported into the <code>train_digit_classifier.ipynb</code> notebook:</p> <pre><code>import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom keras.datasets import mnist\nfrom keras.utils.np_utils import to_categorical\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Flatten, Dropout, Activation\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n</code></pre> <p>Next, the MNIST dataset is loaded and split into training and test data and labels.</p> <pre><code>(train_data, train_labels), (test_data, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()\n</code></pre> <p>After loading the dataset, the data needs to be preprocessed before using it to build the model. One of these processes is to one hot encode the test and train data labels. The original labels of the images are given as a list of numbers: <code>[4,5,7,...,0,9,1]</code>. These need to be converted to one-hot encoding.</p> <p>In one-hot encoding, the label of an image is based off the index position in the label array. For instance, a drawn digit of 4 would have the label array:</p> <p>-<code>[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code></p> <p>Or the integer 9 would be encoded as:</p> <p>-<code>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]</code></p> <p>Without one-hot encoding, the neural network might think there could be values between numbers in a list instead of distinct categories or labels.

This conversion is necessary as the <code>solve_sudoku.py</code> script was written to solve a sudoku puzzle in a list format and not a numpy array.</p> <pre><code>unsolved_board = unsolved_board.tolist()\n</code></pre> <p>Finally a deep copy of the <code>unsolved_board</code> puzzle list is made before passing it into the <code>solve_puzzle()</code> function from the <code>solve_sudoku.py</code> script. This is done to enable the sudoku puzzle solutions to be overlayed (using the <code>display_solutions()</code> function discussed in the next subsection) on the puzzle image while avoiding cells with numbers already present.</p> <pre><code>unsolved_board_copy = copy.deepcopy(unsolved_board) \n\n# Solve puzzle\nsolved_board = solve_puzzle(unsolved_board_copy, debug=False)\n</code></pre> <p>To solve the sudoku puzzle, recursion and backtracking are used. Recursion involves a function calling itself until a base case is reached. For example, to compute the factorial of 5, a function like the one below can be used:</p> <pre><code>def factorial(x):\n    if x ==  0: # Base case\n        return 1\n    return x * factorial(x - 1)\n</code></pre> <p>Calling <code>factorial(5)</code> results to the number 120. The steps of recursively arriving at this output are shown below:</p> <pre><code>factorial(5) =  5 x factorial(4)\n                5 x 4 x factorial(3)\n                5 x 4 x 3 x factorial(2)    \n                5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x factorial(1)\n                5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 x factorial(0)\n                5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 x 1 = 120\n</code></pre> <p>The base case, <code>factorial(0) = 1</code>, is the terminating condition to ensure that the function does not keep recursively calling itself until the program crashes; due to the limit to the number of recursive calls that can be made.</p> <p>Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving constraint-satisfaction problems  recursively without trying all possibilities. Some algorithms that employ backtracking include:</p> <ul> <li>N-Queens problem in chess,</li> <li>Traveling salesperson problem,</li> <li>Graph coloring problem, and </li> <li>Sudoku.</li> </ul> <p>In the case of solving sudoku puzzles, valid guesses to solve the puzzle are constrained by the rules of the game. For a number to be part of a valid set of guesses (recall that guesses can only be from 1 to 9) to fill up an empty cell on the board, the number should not:</p> <ul> <li>already be present in the associated row of the empty cell,</li> <li>already be present in the associated column of the empty cell, and</li> <li>already be present in the associated 3x3 block of the empty cell.</li> </ul> <p>To solve a sudoku puzzle using backtracking, start out with the first empty cell on the board, and the first number from a set of valid guesses is chosen to fill up the cell. The next empty cell is worked on and the first number from the a valid set of guesses is chosen to fill out the cell. If an empty cell is reached that does not have any valid guesses, the solver backtracks to the previous cell and chooses the next guess in the set of valid guesses and tries moving forward. This process continues until the puzzle is solved. </p> <p>A sample of this sudoku solving backtracking process is shown in the diagram below.</p> <p> </p> <p>The <code>solve_puzzle()</code> function, from the <code>solve_sudoku.py</code> script, is the function that attempts to solve the <code>unsolved_board_copy</code> puzzle. The <code>solve_puzzle()</code> code block is shown below:</p> <pre><code># If debug is set to True, check if puzzle is valid\nif debug:\n    if not is_puzzle_valid(puzzle):\n        return False\n\n# Find the next empty space of the puzzle to guess in\nrow, col = find_next_empty(puzzle)\n\n# If find_next_empty() returns None, None that means there is no free space/element left in the\n# puzzle. Since only valid guesses are filled in (using is_guess_valid() function), the puzzle has been solved.\nif row is None:\n    return puzzle\n\n# If there is a space in the puzzle, pick a number from 1 - 9\nfor guess in range(1, 10): \n\n    # Check if guess is valid\n    if is_guess_valid(puzzle, guess, row, col):\n\n        # Place valid guess in the current empty space of the puzzle\n        puzzle[row][col] = guess\n\n        # Recursively call the solve_puzzle() function. Returning True means that the puzzle is solved, \n        # from row/column having a value of None.\n        if solve_puzzle(puzzle):\n            return puzzle\n\n    # If the current guess is not valid, then backtrack and try a different number\n    puzzle[row][col] = 0\n\n# If none of the guesses work, this current iteration of the recursive function is closed and \n# operation is moved up the previous level. If at the end, none of the numbers tried works, the puzzle\n# is declared unsolvable.\nreturn False\n</code></pre> <p>The function starts out by checking if the debug flag is set to <code>True</code>. This feature was added to confirm if the puzzle, prior to any solving attempts, is valid; not having any duplicates in a row, column or 3x3 puzzle block. The puzzle validity check slows the performance of the function, thus the flag is set to <code>False</code> by default. The flag is only set to <code>True</code> to unit test the script with Pytest, discussed afterwards, and to troubleshoot errors encountered in solving the puzzle.</p> <p>The next step is to find the next empty space/cell in the puzzle to guess in. With an empty cell, guesses to fill up the cell are checked for validity using the constraints enumerated earlier. Once the first valid guess is found, it is inputted into the empty cell. After this, <code>solve_puzzle()</code> recursively calls itself and the whole process of picking guesses to fill up empty cells, as explained earlier with the aid of the diagram, is repeated until the puzzle is solved. If there are no more empty cells, the puzzle has been solved and is returned to the <code>solved_board</code> variable.</p> <p>The utility functions used by the <code>solve_puzzle()</code> function are well documented and can be viewed in the <code>solve_sudoku.py</code> script. Credit for the base sudoku solver is attributed to Kylie Ying.</p> <p>Side note about Unit Testing</p> <p>Before advancing to the final step of the sudoku AI solver, the unit tests for the sudoku solver script will be considered. The test script, <code>test_solve_sudoku.py</code>, was written to test edge cases and catch exceptions that the <code>solve_sudoku.py</code> might encounter. The test script initializes the following puzzle lists: <code>puzzle_1</code>, <code>solution_1</code>, <code>puzzle_2</code>, <code>puzzle_3</code>, and <code>puzzle_4</code>. Where <code>puzzle_1</code> is a puzzle to be solved and <code>solution_1</code> is its solution. The lists <code>puzzle_2</code>, <code>puzzle_3</code> and <code>puzzle_4</code> are invalid puzzles that need to have their resultant exceptions caught.</p> <p>The unit tests carried out on the sudoku solver:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Test to confirm that the puzzle and solution are not the same before invoking the solve_puzzle() method,</p> </li> <li> <p>Test to confirm that the puzzle has an element that is not of type <code>int</code>,</p> </li> <li> <p>Test to confirm that the solved puzzle and the provide solution are the same,</p> </li> <li> <p>Test to confirm that there is a duplicate in a puzzle row, and</p> </li> <li> <p>Test to confirm that there is a duplicate in a puzzle block.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The following command runs the unit tests using Pytest:</p> <pre><code>pytest test_solve_sudoku.py\n</code></pre> <p>This command can also be run in the Docker container (to be discussed in a subsequent subsection) of this project.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#display-puzzle-solutions","title":"Display puzzle solutions","text":"<p>Assuming that there are no errors encountered when attempting to solve the sudoku puzzle, the solved puzzle is returned to the <code>solved_board</code> variable and the solutions are displayed on the extracted color puzzle image using the function, <code>display_solutions(cell_locs, color_puzzle)</code>.
