# Sudoku AI Solver

OpenCV and Deep Learning are employed in extracting a sudoku puzzle from images and completing it; the main solver is programmed in Python.
To detect numbers from the sudoku board weâ€™ll use a pre-trained OCR model. OCR or Optical Character Recognition is a technology that recognizes text within a digital image.
