# Sudoku AI Solver

In this project, a Sudoku Artificial Intelligence (AI) puzzle solver is built using python, OpenCV, Deep Learning and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) methods to solve puzzles obtained from images. The steps needed to build this solver are outlined in the following flow chart (adapted from [Pyimagesearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/08/10/opencv-sudoku-solver-and-ocr/)).

(to be completed)
